## Potential Attack Vectors

### 1. SQL Injection

**Example**:  
- An attacker might submit a URL with SQL code, such as `https://yourdomain.com/encode?original_link=https://abc.com'; DROP TABLE links;--`, which could drop a table if not properly sanitized.

**Risk**:  
- Attackers could delete or modify data, or even access sensitive information from the database.

**Mitigation**:
- Validate `params[:original_link]` before creating new record.
- Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with ActiveRecord in Rails.

---

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Example**:  
- An attacker could input a script like `<script>alert('Hacked');</script>` in the `original_link` parameter of the `/encode` endpoint.

**Risk**:  

- Lead to the theft of user data, session hijacking, or defacing the website.

**Mitigation**:

- Validate `params[:original_link]` before creating new record.

---

### 3. Rate Limiting and Abuse

**Example**:  
- An attacker might repeatedly send requests to the `/encode` endpoint to flood the server with excessive data or cause resource exhaustion.

**Risk**:  
- DoS (Denial of Service), or excessive resource consumption, leading to performance degradation or outages.

**Mitigation**:  
- Restrict the number of requests per user or IP address.
- Use API keys or authentication to enforce stricter access control.

---

### 4. Open Redirect

**Example**:  
- An attacker might craft a link like `http://yourdomain.com/redirect?url=http://malicious-site.com`, leading users to a harmful site.

**Risk**:  
- redirect users to malicious sites that steal credentials or deliver malware.

**Mitigation**:  
- Validate and sanitize any URL input before performing a redirect.
- Only allow redirects to trusted internal URLs or a whitelist of approved domains.

---

### 5. Phishing and Malicious Content

**Example**:  
- An attacker could use a shortened URL to redirect users to a fake login page designed to steal credentials or distribute malicious files.

**Risk**:  
- Phishing and malicious content attacks can result in data theft, identity theft, and malware infections.

**Mitigation**:  
- Ensure the system uses HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implement input sanitization, and educate users to recognize phishing attempts.
- Block or filter known malicious URLs and use strong user authentication mechanisms.

---

### 6. Unauthorized API Access

**Example**:  
- An attacker might try to access `/decode` without proper authentication to gain access to sensitive data, such as decoding a URL that they shouldn't have access to.

**Risk**:  
- Unauthorized API access can expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized actions, leading to information leakage or malicious activities.

**Mitigation**:  
- Use API authentication mechanisms such as OAuth, API tokens, or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.

---

### 7. Denial of Service (DoS)

**Example**:  
- An attacker may flood the `/encode` endpoint with a large number of requests, causing the server to become unresponsive or crash.

**Risk**:  
- Cause downtime, loss of availability, and potential loss of business or customer trust.

**Mitigation**:  
- Implement rate limiting, use load balancing, and deploy DDoS protection services.
- Caching.

## Scaling and Collision Handling

### 1. Scaling Strategy
- Delete inactive records or set expiration values for records, and then remove them when expired.
- Implement caching systems like Redis or CDN to reduce database query load.
- Create indexes on the `original_url` and `short_url` columns to speed up query times, but consider the additional database resource usage.
- Use database sharding techniques to distribute data across multiple servers and enhance scalability.
- Implement load balancing to distribute incoming traffic efficiently across multiple servers.
- Use distributed data systems like Elasticsearch, Solr.
- Using background workers like Sidekiq or Delayed Job

### 2. Collision Handling
- Database Constraints: using a unique constraint on the short_url column ensures no two records can share the same shortened URL.
- Database Transactions: using transactions ensures that if any step in the URL shortening process fails, all previous changes are rolled back, thus maintaining a consistent state in the database.
- Pessimistic Locking: When a record is being written, a lock is applied to prevent other requests from writing to the same record simultaneously.
- Optimistic Locking: This involves checking the current state of a record before updating it, to avoid conflicts when multiple requests try to create the same shortened URL.
